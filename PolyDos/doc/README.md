# PolyDos Documentation

Files here:

* PolyDos2_doc.pdf - manual set for PolyDos 2. Includes:
  * Introduction
  * PolyDos Users Guide
  * PolyDos System Programmers Guide
  * PolyDos Utilities Guide (FORMAT, BACKUP and SuperZap)
  * PolyEdit Users Guide
  * PolyZap (assembler) Users Guide
  * PolyDos disk BASIC Guide (The disk BASIC is a set of extensions to NASCOM ROM BASIC and requires ROM BASIC to be present)

* Polytext.pdf - manual for the PolyText word processing system

The documentation states that it was created using the "PolyText word processing
system" and the PolyDos 2 disk image includes PolyText 2.0 (PTXT.GO)

Thanks to Bob Edwards for supplying Polytext.pdf -- I had never seen this
documentation and had lost all hope of ever locating a copy.

The manual set doesn't explicitly state that it is for PolyDos 2, but Section 2
of the PolyDos Users Guide describes the disks/controllers associated with
PolyDos 2 and the ROM listing at the end of the System Programmers Guide has the
title "PolyDos 2".
