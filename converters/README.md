# Converters

Here are PERL programs for converting NASCOM files between different formats.

* [nascon](nascon) - convert between nas/cas/bin/hex/dmp formats.
* [wav2bin](wav2bin) - converts NASCOM audio files at 1200 or 300 baud into binary.
* nas2cas - (obsolete) convert .nas format to .cas
* cas2nas - (obsolete) convert .cas format to .nas (also spits out a binary file)
* [sy_extract](sy_extract) - Polydos allowed creation of a symbol table in a compiled format that could be read in to the polyzap assembler. This program reads a symbol table in this compiled format and writes it out as a set of equates.
* polydos_vfs - mount upto 4 PolyDos disk images and inspect/manipulate them. Extensive built-in [help](polydos_vfs_help.md)
* [toZ80](toZ80) - convert assembler source from 8080 mnemonics to Z80 mnemonics. This originated as an AWK script written by Douglas Beattie Jr. cira 2003, but it had some bugs. I used a2p to convert it to PERL then fixed the bugs and added support for some 8080 instructions that had been missing.

All of those programs are written in PERL. If you use Linux or Mac you will have
PERL installed. If you use Windows I recommend Strawberry PERL which is free.

And miscellaneous/general-purpose converters:

* bin2char_array - convert a binary file to a C char data structure.


## NASCOM File formats

Files for use with NASCOM emulators are commonly of 2 file types: .nas and .cas

A .nas file is ASCII text, a hex dump in the format produced by the NAS-SYS "T" command.

In a real system, a .nas file would be loaded into memory using the NAS-SYS 1
"L" command (the "L" command was removed from NAS-SYS 3). In emulation, a .nas
file is typically loaded directly into memory under the control of the emulator.

A .cas file is binary, in the cassette tape format produced by the NAS-SYS "W"
or "G" commands or by programs that use the NAS-SYS sub-routines (e.g. NASCOM 8K
ROM BASIC).

In a real system. a .cas file represents the byte stream that would be recovered
from the cassette interface and loaded into memory under the control of the
NAS-SYS "R" command. In emulation, a .cas file is typically presented by the
emulator as a serial byte stream that is read by the emulated cassette
interface.


### .cas format

by default it is just a sequence of binary blocks. The format can be inferred
from the NAS-SYS listing.

However..

.. if it is a BASIC program it has a header which is a single letter.

BASIC will not load a program until it has found one of these headers. From
BASIC, CLOAD with no argument will read the *next* header and its data. CLOAD
with an argument will report each header in turn until it finds the right one,
and will then load.

The header has this format:

    0xd3 0xd3 0xd3 0xZZ

where ZZ is the "file-name"

When NAS-SYS is waiting for input from the keyboard, it will also accept input
from tape. Therefore, some .cas (and .nas) files also have ASCII text strings
before/after the main program data.

For example, a .cas file generated by the NAS-SYS 3 "G" command has this format:

    (CR)E0(CR)R(CR)

then data in the same format as the "W" command, then

    Ezzzz(CR)

where zzzz is the execution address of the program, as supplied to the G command.


### .nas format

Lines are in one of 2 formats:

1/ a 4-digit hex load address value followed by between 1 and 8 2-digit hex data
values. Each value is space-separated from the others. For example:

    1000 0A 0A 91 57 91 3D 53 E8
    1008 11 6A C5 12 96

2/ a 4-digit hex load address value followed by 9 2-digit hex data values. Each
value is space-separated from the others. In this case, the 9th value is the
mod-256 sum of the 10 previous bytes (the address counts as 2 bytes). For example:

    1000 0A 0A 91 57 91 3D 53 E8 15
    1008 11 6A C5 12 96 A8 14 51 0D

In both cases, the line ends with a (CR). In some cases, there are CTRL-H and
NUL (ASCII 0) characters at the end of the line before the (CR).

In principle, the two formats can be mixed in a single file. However, if they
were generated by NAS-SYS all lines in a file will be in the same format.

Some .nas files seem to have other line-ending formats, for example (CR)(LF)

If a .nas file was being loaded on a real system under the control of NAS--SYS,
it would be loaded using the "L" command. The "L" command is terminated by a "."
and therefore some .nas files end in the same way. For example:

    2938 25 CA 26 DE 27 66 27 FA
    2940 27 43 28 72
    .

An emulator that loads .nas files directly into memory should ignore the "."



### nas2cas

parse a .nas file. Generate the equivalent .cas file. By default there is no additional header
or trailer.

FUTURES/TODO:

    -g zzzz -- add ASCII header/trailer in NAS-SYS "G"enerate format, with an execution address of zzzz
    -b Z    -- add MBASIC header with file-name Z


### cas2nas

parse a .cas file. Report any header/trailer information. Generate the equivalent .nas file. By default
there is no additional header or trailer.

FUTURES/TODO:

    -t      -- add "." trailer
