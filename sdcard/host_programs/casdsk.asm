;;; Load and execute somewhere out-of-the-way because it
;;; stays in memory.
;;;
;;; Allows disk load/store for a program that was designed to
;;; use the W and R tape routines.
;;; Intercepts the W and R routines and redirects them to a
;;; single pre-defined disk file. Acts as a "terminate and stay
;;; resident" program and therefore must sit in free memory
;;; somewhere.
;;;
;;; Example: Colossal cave adventure can "save" the game state
;;; but uses tape routines to do so. So, do this:
;;;   $ CASDSK CAVE.ME
;;;   Installed
;;;   $ COLOSSAL
;;;
;;; Now, any call to the W command (write to tape) will
;;; actually write to the file CAVE.ME, deleting any
;;; pre-existing file of that name. Any call to the R command
;;; (read from tape) will result in the contents of CAVE.ME
;;; being loaded into memory at the address from which it was
;;; saved.
;;;
;;;   $ CASDSK
;;;   Uninstalled
;;;
;;; When executed like this, with no operands, the normal R and
;;; W vectors are restored; The memory used by CASDSK can now be
;;; reused.
;;;
;;;   $ CASDSK
;;;   Not installed
;;;
;;; When executed like this, with no operands, if not previously
;;; installed, just displays a message and returns.
;;;
;;; The usual operation of PolyDos is to read and write data
;;; with a minimal granularity of 256 bytes. When saving, the
;;; same approach is taken: the write data is rounded up to
;;; the nearest 256 bytes. However, that may not be acceptable
;;; on reads, because it may overwrite data in memory.
;;; Therefore, on writes, the valid data size in the final
;;; sector (1-256 bytes) is stored in the low byte of the
;;; "execution address" entry of the data file (CAVE.ME in
;;; the example above). On reads, this size byte is used to
;;; transfer the file size.
;;;
;;; The algorithm can support any file size but the NAS-SYS
;;; calls that are intercepted are limited to a maximum size
;;; of 64Kbyte.
;;;
;;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; original plan was $c80 but Level 9 adventures use this area
;;; so try top-of-RAM instead. YMMV and you may want a couple of
;;; versions, assembled for different addresses.
