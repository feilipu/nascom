* doc - user handbook, schematics and layout drawings
* tools - for creating SDcard image
* photos - the assembled board
* [PolyDos](PolyDos/README.md) - a port of PolyDos that uses the NASCOM 4 SDcard for virtual disk storage
* [cpm](cpm/README.md) - a port of CP/M 2.2 for the MAP80 VFC that uses the NASCOM 4 SDcard for virtual disk storage
* [tools](tools/README.md) - tools for creating and manipulating SDcard images for the NASCOM 4

The FPGA VHDL code and KiCad design database is here: https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/tree/master/multicomp/NASCOM4

The pre-built files for programming the FPGA are here: https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/tree/master/multicomp/NASCOM4/output_files

Current releases:

Rev1.0 - first release (NASCOM4_rev1p0.pof/NASCOM4_rev1p0.sof)
Rev1.1 - revisons to video control: (1) both VGA outputs are now active simultaneously. (2) The character generator is now programmable from the Z80 (details in the Handbook) (NASCOM4_rev1p1.pof/NASCOM4_rev1p1.sof)

Here are some videos of its evolution:

If anyone is interested in a PCB (note the need for some cuts and wires - refer to the handbook) the price is £10 and includes a couple of components that I bought in bulk (the SDcard adaptor and the FPGA sockets). I priced up the total parts cost at about £70 but there are multiple build options (again, refer to the handbook). If anyone wants a more complete kit, or an assembled board, let me know and I will work out prices (but there will be a lead time on those because of various parts coming from China).
