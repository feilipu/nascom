# NASCOM 4

* doc - user guide, schematics and layout drawings
* tools - for creating SDcard image

The FPGA VHDL code and KiCad design database is here: https://github.com/nealcrook/multicomp6809/tree/master/multicomp/NASCOM4


Here are some videos of its evolution:

If anyone is interested in a PCB (note the need for some cuts and wires - refer to the handbook) the price is £10 and includes a couple of components that I bought in bulk (the SDcard adaptor and the FPGA sockets). I priced up the total parts cost at about £70 but there are multiple build options (again, refer to the handbook). If anyone wants a more complete kit, or an assembled board, let me know and I will work out prices (but there will be a lead time on those because of various parts coming from China).
